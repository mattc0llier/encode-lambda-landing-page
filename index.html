      </header>

        <p>Hey Lambda School students ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <br>
        <p>You are changing how we enable people to understand the world. Every
          individual can take control of their learning.</p>

        <p>A new wave of digital-first education finally allows us to give you internet
        superpowers for your learning. We now have the ability to track and analyse
        the content we are trying to learn and compare that to what you currently
        understand.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Encode is a live educational notes app that can help you to track and
        optimise your understanding of the Lambda School syllabus.</h2>
        <br>
        <section class="benefits">
          <div class="">
            <h4>Concentrate solely on active learning.</h4>
            <p>Everything is recorded so you can completely focus on understanding the content.
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Nativgate instantly through perfect educational memory.</h4>
            <p>Have 100% memory to instantly jump back through your educational journey.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Stay in the moment.</h4>
            <p>Minimal interface and smart moments mean you can save certain points in
              your journey without having to manually provide all of your contextual
              metadata.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <br>
        <p>Itâ€™s like a mix of <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> and <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> for your learning.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The MVP will allow you too:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Automatically track your entire educational journey through Lambda
            School and additional educational content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instantly navigate your educational history through your usual notes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assign what concepts you have learnt and what you are yet to fully
            understand
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>and this is just the startâ€¦</p>

        <br>
        <p>
          If you curious about where education is going in the impending
            revolution, this is just the start and I need your feedback to build the
            future of personal learning tools.
