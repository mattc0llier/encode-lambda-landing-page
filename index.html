      <h1>How can you optimise your Lambda School education?</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Hey Lambda School students ðŸ‘‹</p>
    <br>
    <p>You are changing how we enable people to understand the world. Every
      individual can take control of their learning.</p>

    <p>A new wave of digital-first education finally allows us to give you internet
    superpowers for your learning. We now have the ability to track and analyse
    the content we are trying to learn and compare that to what you currently
    understand.</p>

    <h2>I am building a live educational notes app that can help you to track and
    optimise your understanding of the Lambda School syllabus.</h2>

    <h4>Concentrate solely on active learning.</h4>
    <p>Focus on understanding the content, not tracking what youâ€™ve been doing.</p>

    <h4>Have perfect educational memory.</h4>
    <p>Have 100% memory to instantly jump back through your educational journey.</p>

    <h4>Stay in the moment.</h4>
    <p>Minimal interface and smart moments mean you can save certain points in
      your journey without having to manually provide all of your contextual
      metadata.</p>

      <p>Itâ€™s like a mix of <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> and <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> for your learning.</p>

      <p>The MVP will allow you too:</p>


      <ul> Automatically track your entire educational journey through Lambda
        School and additional educational content.</ul>
      <ul> Instantly navigate your educational history through your usual notes.</ul>
      <ul> Assign what concepts you have learnt and what you are yet to fully
        understand</ul>

      <p>and this is just the startâ€¦</p>

      [Journey]
      Track â†’ Analyse â†’ Activate â†’ Optimise

      <p>If you curious about where education is going in the impending
        revolution, this is just the start and I need your feedback to build the
        future of personal learning tools.</p>

      <p>Letâ€™s take the first step on a much longer journey to life-long
        learning.</p>

      <p>Cheers, Matt ðŸ‘‹</p>
